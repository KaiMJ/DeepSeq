# Evaluating ML/DL Models for Trading Strategies

## Abstract

Machine learning has revolutionized financial trading by enabling data-driven decision-making, pattern recognition, portfolio optimization, risk management, and predictive modeling. This project explores to benchmark several machine learning techniques, mainly machine learning and deep learning models, in algorithmic trading for predictive modeling. Exploratory and statistical data analysis, feature engineering (earnings date, technical indicators) and multi-interval (minute candle to daily candles) trading strategies, are performed. Challenges of overfitting, position sizing are taken into account during monte carlo simulation, backtest, and forward test, while quantitatively measuring returns and drawdowns with realistic slippage and commissions. This project aims to highlight the opportunities and limitations of integrating machine learning in modern financial markets.
